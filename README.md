# StoryPods

StoryPods is final project for the File Organization and Database Management class taught in winter 2018 at the 
Southern Methodist University by Professor Daniel W. Engels.

Here you will find:
 * A prototype of a geospatially -enabled, augmented reality game where players search for virtual
 objects and reveal a story.
 * Our database model. You can open it in [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
 * LaTex -formatted presentation materials 
 
The project emphasis is on designing a database management system that can efficiently collect and store geospatial data,
 and enforce the game rules.
